# When Confidence Signals Disagree: Local and Global Confidence in Autoregressive Language Model

## Abstract

Modern predictive systems expose multiple quantities that are commonly interpreted as measures of confidence. However, these quantities can summarize different aspects of the predictive process. This distinction matters when confidence is used to evaluate reliability or inform downstream oversight and control. We investigate whether different confidence readouts are empirically interchangeable in an autoregressive language model by comparing local confidence, defined from the probability of the greedy-selected answer token, with global confidence, defined from modal-answer frequency under repeated sampling. Across MMLU and ARC Challenge, the two signals are weakly correlated (r = 0.086 and $r = 0 . 1 7 5$ , respectively) and differ substantially in their association with correctness: global confidence is moderately associated with correctness $( r ~ = ~ 0 . 4 9 4$ and $r \ : = \ : 0 . 3 7 4 )$ whereas local confidence shows little association (r = 0.102 and $r = 0 . 0 7 2 )$ . We further test whether question-level disagreement between the signals is associated with sampling instability. On ARC, larger local–global confidence gaps are associated with higher answer entropy (Spearman $\rho = 0 . 4 2 )$ more distinct sampled answers $( \rho = 0 . 4 1 )$ , and lower modalanswer concentration $( \rho = - 0 . 4 2 )$ . The gap–entropy association persists when disagreement and instability are estimated from disjoint stochastic samples, indicating that it is not explained by shared finite-sample variation. The corresponding relationship is substantially weaker on MMLU, where only 4% of questions exhibit sampling instability. These results show that confidence readouts derived from the same predictive system are not empirically interchangeable and that their disagreement can provide a diagnostic of unstable sampling behavior. Confidence should therefore be treated as an explicitly defined measurement rather than as a single intrinsic scalar property of a model, particularly when it is used to inform downstream evaluation, oversight, or control.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models increasingly participate in systems that must decide not only what to predict, but also how much confidence to place in that prediction. Confidence estimates are used to evaluate calibration, trigger abstention or human review, weight feedback, support selective prediction, and characterize the reliability of aligned models [18]. In these settings, confidence functions as an interface between the model’s predictive behavior and downstream mechanisms for oversight and control.

Yet “model confidence” is not a uniquely defined quantity. Modern language models expose several signals that are routinely interpreted as confidence, including token probabilities, sampled-answer frequencies, verbalized confidence, and other derived uncertainty estimates. Prior work has shown that such signals can differ substantially in calibration and reliability [10, 18]. This raises a more basic measurement question: when different readouts of the same predictive system are called confidence, to what extent do they actually describe the same behavioral state?

We study this question in a deliberately simple setting. In an autoregressive language model, a local confidence signal can be obtained from the conditional probability assigned to a selected answer token, whereas a global confidence signal can be estimated from the concentration of answers produced under repeated sampling. These quantities are statistically distinct by construction: one summarizes a particular conditional decision, while the other summarizes the induced distribution over complete sampled answers. There is therefore no theoretical requirement that they coincide. The empirical questions are instead how large that mismatch is in practice, whether the two signals carry equivalent information about correctness, and whether their disagreement is systematically related to observable instability in model behavior.

These questions matter beyond the choice of uncertainty metric. Alignment and reliability procedures increasingly rely on confidence as a signal for deciding when a model should be trusted, corrected, deferred, or assigned greater or lesser weight. If confidence depends materially on how the predictive distribution is interrogated, then downstream procedures may be conditioning on different properties of the same model while treating them as a common quantity. Before confidence can be aligned with correctness, preferences, human judgments, or external feedback, its operational meaning must therefore be made explicit.

We investigate this issue using a locally served Llama 3.3 70B model. The primary local–global comparison uses MMLU and ARC, whose constrained answer spaces allow token-level probabilities and sampled-answer frequencies to be compared at a common answer level. Local confidence is defined as the probability assigned to the greedy-selected answer token; global confidence is the empirical frequency of the modal answer under repeated sampling; and their disagreement is measured at the question level by the absolute difference between these signals.

The experiments reveal three main patterns. First, local and global confidence show weak empirical agreement on both MMLU and ARC, with non-trivial confidence gaps occurring for a substantial fraction of questions. Second, the signals differ markedly in their association with correctness: sampled answer concentration is moderately associated with correctness, whereas local token confidence shows little association. Third, on ARC, larger local–global confidence gaps are systematically associated with greater sampling instability, including higher answer entropy, more distinct sampled answers, and lower modal-answer concentration. This relationship persists when confidence disagreement and sampling instability are estimated from disjoint stochastic samples, indicating that it is not explained by shared finite-sample variation. The corresponding relationship is substantially weaker on MMLU, where sampling instability is rare.

These findings shift the focus from whether different confidence signals can disagree, which follows from their definitions, to whether that disagreement is empirically consequential. We make three contributions:

1. We provide a controlled empirical characterization of local token confidence and global sampled-answer concentration as distinct confidence measurements within the same autoregressive model.

2. We show that these signals exhibit weak agreement and substantially different associations with answer correctness.

3. We directly link question-level confidence disagreement to sampling instability, finding a consistent association on ARC that persists under disjoint-sample estimation, alongside a substantially weaker relationship in the lowinstability MMLU regime.

More broadly, the results suggest that confidence should be treated as an explicitly defined measurement of model behavior rather than as a single intrinsic scalar property. This distinction becomes especially important when confidence is used as an input to evaluation, oversight, or alignment procedures: disagreement between confidence readouts implies that the choice of measurement can itself determine what downstream systems infer about the model’s uncertainty.

## 2 Related Work

Calibration and confidence in neural networks. A large literature studies whether predictive confidence corresponds to empirical correctness. Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana [14] examine methods for obtaining reliable probability estimates from supervised classifiers, while Guo et al. [5] show that modern neural networks can be poorly calibrated and demonstrate that post-hoc temperature scaling can substantially improve calibration. These approaches generally begin with a specified scalar confidence score and ask whether that score is calibrated. Our work addresses a complementary question: when multiple quantities derived from the same predictive process can reasonably be interpreted as confidence, do they provide empirically interchangeable measurements? In language models, Jiang et al. [7] show that probability-based confidence can vary in reliability across question types and model scales, while Zhao et al. [22] study the relationship between sequence likelihood and generation quality. We focus specifically on the relationship between a local tokenprobability readout and the concentration of the answer distribution induced by repeated sampling.

Uncertainty and confidence in language models. Language models admit several operationalizations of confidence beyond token probabilities. Kadavath et al. [8] study model self-evaluation, Lin et al. [11] train models to express uncertainty in words, and Xiong et al. [20] examine different methods for eliciting confidence from LLMs. Tian et al. [18] further show that confidence elicitation and calibration depend on how confidence is obtained from models fine-tuned with human feedback. More directly related to the present measurement question, Kumar et al. [10] compare verbalized confidence with token-level probabilities and find that the two can be weakly aligned. Together, these results demonstrate that different confidence readouts need not behave equivalently. We extend this comparison to two quantities derived directly from the predictive process: the probability of the greedy-selected answer token and the empirical concentration of answers under repeated sampling.

Sampling-based uncertainty and self-consistency. Repeated generation provides an alternative view of model uncertainty by characterizing the distribution of outputs produced for the same input. Malinin and Gales [12] develop uncertainty measures for autoregressive structured prediction based on sequence-level predictive distributions, while Kuhn et al. [9] address an important complication in openended language generation by grouping semantically equivalent responses before computing entropy. Our use of constrained multiple-choice answer spaces avoids this additional semantic-equivalence problem and permits sampled answer concentration to be estimated directly.

Sampling distributions are also used for inference. In particular, Wang et al. [19] show that aggregating multiple sampled reasoning paths through majority voting can improve reasoning accuracy, and Chen et al. [2] extend self-consistency methods to more general generation settings. These studies demonstrate that repeated samples contain behaviorally useful information beyond a single generated output. Our focus is different: we use the sampled answer distribution as a confidence readout and ask how it relates to token-level confidence and question-level sampling instability.

Confidence, elicitation, and downstream decision making. The distinction between confidence readouts becomes consequential when confidence is used by downstream systems. Prompt formulation and elicitation can materially affect model probabilities and outputs [17, 21], while internal representations can contain information that is not straightforwardly reflected in surface responses [1, 13]. These findings motivate caution in treating any single observable confidence signal as a complete description of the model’s predictive state.

This issue also arises in deployed decision pipelines. For example, Ren et al. [16] use repeated LLM outputs with conformal prediction for robotic task planning rather than relying directly on token-level probabilities. More generally, when confidence is used for abstention, deferral, feedback, or control, the operational definition of confidence determines what information is supplied to the downstream mechanism. Our study isolates this measurement problem by directly comparing local token confidence with sampling-derived answer concentration and testing whether their disagreement is associated with observable sampling instability.

## 3 Local and Global Confidence

Let $x \in \mathcal { X }$ denote an input and $y ^ { \ast } \in \mathcal { V }$ the corresponding ground-truth output. An autoregressive model induces a distribution over output sequences,

$$
\hat { P } ( y \mid x ) = \prod _ { t = 1 } ^ { T } \hat { P } ( y _ { t } \mid y _ { < t } , x ) .\tag{1}
$$

This predictive distribution can support different scalar quantities that may be interpreted as confidence. We focus on two such quantities: a local confidence signal derived from a conditional prediction at a particular generation step, and a global confidence signal derived from the distribution over complete outputs.

Local confidence. Local confidence is derived from a conditional probability

$$
c _ { l o c a l } = \hat { P } ( y _ { t } \mid y _ { < t } , x ) ,\tag{2}
$$

and therefore characterizes the concentration of probability at an individual autoregressive decision point. In the experiments below, we operationalize this quantity using the probability assigned to the greedy-selected answer token.

Global confidence. Global confidence characterizes concentration in the induced distribution over complete outputs. For an output-level answer a, this distribution can be approximated through repeated sampling from the model. We operationalize global confidence as the empirical probability of the modal answer,

$$
c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x ) = \operatorname* { m a x } _ { a } { \hat { P } } ( a \mid x ) ,\tag{3}
$$

where ${ \hat { P } } ( a \mid x )$ denotes the empirical answer distribution obtained from repeated samples.

Local–global disagreement. Local and global confidence summarize different aspects of the same predictive process. The former measures probability concentration at a particular conditional decision, whereas the latter measures concentration after complete generated outputs are mapped to answers. There is therefore no requirement that the two quantities coincide.

For each input, we quantify their disagreement by the absolute confidence gap

$$
D ( x ) = \left| c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } ( x ) - c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x ) \right| .\tag{4}
$$

The existence of such disagreement is not itself surprising: local conditional probabilities and output-level concentration are distinct statistical quantities. The empirical questions are instead how strongly these confidence signals agree in practice, whether they exhibit similar relationships with correctness, and whether the magnitude of their disagreement is associated with variability in the model’s sampled outputs.

For the latter comparison, we define correctness as

$$
z ( x ) = \mathbb { I } ( \hat { y } ( x ) = y ^ { * } ) .\tag{5}
$$

We treat the relationship between each confidence signal and $z ( x )$ as a confidence–correctness association rather than as a sufficient characterization of probabilistic calibration.

## 4 Sampling Instability

The preceding section defines local and global confidence as distinct summaries of an autoregressive predictive process. We now consider whether disagreement between these confidence signals is associated with variability in the model’s sampled outputs.

## 4.1 Repeated Sampling and Output Variability

For a fixed input x and sampling configuration, repeated generation induces an empirical distribution over answers,

$$
\hat { P } ( a \mid x ) = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \mathbb { I } ( a _ { i } = a ) ,\tag{6}
$$

where $a _ { i }$ denotes the answer obtained from the ith sampled output.

The concentration of this distribution provides a direct measure of sampling stability. If repeated samples consistently produce the same answer, the empirical distribution is concentrated and the model is stable for that input under the specified sampling configuration. If probability mass is distributed across multiple answers, the input exhibits greater sampling instability.

## 4.2 Measures of Sampling Instability

We characterize sampling instability using complementary properties of the empirical answer distribution. These include its Shannon entropy,

$$
H ( x ) = - \sum _ { a } { \hat { P } } ( a \mid x ) \log { \hat { P } } ( a \mid x ) ,\tag{7}
$$

the number of distinct answers observed across repeated samples, and the empirical probability of the modal answer. We additionally define an input as unstable when repeated sampling produces more than one distinct answer.

These measures capture different aspects of the same phenomenon: entropy measures dispersion across answers, distinct-answer count measures support size, and modalanswer probability measures concentration on the most frequently generated answer.

## 4.3 Confidence Disagreement and Sampling Instability

The local–global confidence gap

$$
D ( x ) = | c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } ( x ) - c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x ) |\tag{8}
$$

provides an input-level measure of disagreement between the two confidence signals. Sampling instability provides a separate characterization of variability in the model’s generated answers.

We test whether these quantities are systematically associated at the question level. Specifically, we examine whether larger local–global confidence gaps are associated with greater answer entropy, a larger number of distinct answers, lower modal-answer probability, and a greater likelihood of producing more than one answer under repeated sampling.

This analysis is associative rather than causal. In particular, $c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x )$ and the sampling-instability measures are estimated from repeated outputs of the same predictive process and are therefore statistically related by construction. The analysis asks whether local–global confidence disagreement tracks observable sampling instability; it does not establish whether disagreement produces instability, instability produces disagreement, or both arise from properties of the underlying predictive distribution.

## 5 Experimental Setup

We investigate three empirical questions: (1) how strongly local and global confidence agree on the same inputs; (2) whether the two signals exhibit similar relationships with correctness; and (3) whether the magnitude of local–global disagreement is associated with sampling instability at the question level. We additionally test whether the latter relationship persists when confidence disagreement and sampling instability are estimated from non-overlapping stochastic samples.

All analyses use a locally served llama3.3:70b-q4\_H\_K [4] language model accessed through the Ollama API [15] with logprobs=true. Our instantiation required approximately 48 GB of RAM/VRAM and was run on an M2 Ultra Mac Studio with 64 GB of RAM. No GPU cluster or proprietary API was used.

## 5.1 Datasets

The primary analysis uses 100 questions from MMLU [6] (high\_school\_us\_history) and 100 questions from ARC Challenge [3]. Both benchmarks use constrained multiple-choice answer spaces, allowing token-level probabilities and sampled answer frequencies to be compared at a common answer level.

This restriction is deliberate. In open-ended generation, semantically equivalent answers can differ in surface form, making answer-frequency estimates dependent on an additional semantic-equivalence procedure. The constrained answer spaces of MMLU and ARC isolate the relationship between local token confidence and sampled answer concentration without introducing this additional source of variation.

One ARC question lacked a valid local-confidence measurement and is excluded from analyses requiring both confidence signals, yielding n = 100 for MMLU and $n = 9 9$ for ARC.

Prompts follow the same zero-shot multiple-choice format across the primary analyses.

## 5.2 Confidence Signals

For each question, we estimate local and global confidence using separate readouts of the same autoregressive predictive process.

Local confidence. Local confidence is the probability assigned to the greedy-selected answer token,

$$
c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } ( x ) = p _ { \theta } ( a ^ { * } \mid x ) , \qquad a ^ { * } = \arg \operatorname* { m a x } _ { a } p _ { \theta } ( a \mid x ) .\tag{9}
$$

The probability is obtained from the model’s token-level log-probability output using a separate greedy call at $T = 0$

Global confidence. Global confidence is the empirical frequency of the modal answer under repeated stochastic sampling,

$$
c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x ) = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \mathbf { 1 } [ a _ { i } = \hat { a } ] , \qquad \hat { a } = \arg \operatorname* { m a x } _ { a } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \mathbf { 1 } [ a _ { i } = a ] ,\tag{10}
$$

where $a _ { i }$ denotes the answer obtained from the ith sample.

For the primary analysis, $c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } }$ is estimated from 60 samples at $T ~ = ~ 0 . 7$ . These comprise two existing 30-draw batches generated using the same prompt and samplingtemperature configuration. Pooling the batches provides the primary estimate of the sampled answer distribution.

## 5.3 Sampling Instability

Repeated stochastic generation induces an empirical answer distribution ${ \hat { P } } ( a \mid x )$ . We characterize question-level sampling instability using four complementary summaries of this distribution: Shannon entropy,

$$
H ( x ) = - \sum _ { a } { \hat { P } } ( a \mid x ) \log { \hat { P } } ( a \mid x ) ,\tag{11}
$$

the number of distinct sampled answers, the empirical probability of the modal answer, and a binary instability indicator equal to one when more than one distinct answer is observed.

The primary instability measurements are estimated from 30 samples per question at $T = 0 . 7$

## 5.4 Primary Analyses

Local–global agreement. We measure agreement between the two confidence signals using Pearson correlation $r ( c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } , c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } )$ . Question-level disagreement is defined as the absolute confidence gap

$$
D ( x ) = | c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } ( x ) - c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x ) | .\tag{12}
$$

We additionally report the mean gap and the fraction of questions for which $D ( x )$ exceeds 0.1 and 0.2.

Confidence–correctness association. For each confidence signal, we measure its Pearson correlation with binary answer correctness. These quantities compare how strongly the two confidence readouts are associated with correctness; they are not interpreted as complete measures of probabilistic calibration.

Confidence disagreement and sampling instability. The central question-level analysis tests whether $D ( x )$ is associated with sampling instability. Because the instability measures are non-Gaussian and contain many tied observations, we use Spearman rank correlation for continuous and ordinal measures. For the binary instability indicator, stable and unstable questions are compared using the Mann–Whitney U test and rank-biserial effect size. Multiple tests within this analysis are corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.

As a companion analysis, we test the association between $c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } ( x )$ alone and the same instability measures. Because $c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } }$ is obtained from a separate greedy log-probability call, it does not share stochastic samples with the instability estimates. This analysis tests whether the gap–instability relationship can be reduced to a simpler relationship between low local confidence and unstable sampling.

## 5.5 Disjoint-Sample Robustness

The primary 60-sample estimate of $c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } }$ includes the 30 baseline draws used to estimate sampling instability. Consequently, the primary estimates of $D ( x )$ and sampling instability partially share finite-sample variation.

We directly test whether this overlap accounts for the observed association using disjoint sampling subsets. For each question, the 30 baseline stochastic draws are randomly divided into two non-overlapping sets of 15. One subset is used to estimate $c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } }$ and hence $D ( x )$ , while the complementary subset is used to estimate sampling entropy. We repeat this procedure across 200 random partitions and report the distribution of the resulting question-level Spearman correlations.

This analysis removes shared Monte Carlo draws between the two estimates. It does not make global confidence and sampling entropy conceptually independent: both remain summaries of the same underlying answer distribution. It therefore tests robustness to shared finite-sample variation rather than causal independence.

## 5.6 Experimental Overview

Table 1 summarizes the empirical design. Rather than treating each derived statistic as a separate experiment, the analyses are organized around the measurements required to test the three primary questions.

The first two analyses construct the confidence and instability measurements. The third provides the central test of whether disagreement between confidence readouts tracks sampling instability. The fourth tests whether this relationship persists when the two quantities are estimated from non-overlapping stochastic draws.

Table 2: Local–global confidence agreement and association with correctness. MMLU: 100 questions; ARC: 99 questions (one question lacked a valid local-confidence measurement). Global confidence is estimated from 60 pooled samples at $T = 0 . 7$ . Pearson r values are reported with 95% CIs obtained via Fisher z-transformation. Gap is $D ( x ) = | c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } } ( x ) - c _ { \mathrm { g l o b a l } } ( x ) | .$

## 6 Results

## 6.1 Local and Global Confidence Show Weak Agreement

Local and global confidence show weak empirical agreement (Table 2). Their Pearson correlation is $r = 0 . 0 8 6$ (95% CI $[ - 0 . 1 1 2 , 0 . 2 7 8 ] )$ on MMLU and $\begin{array} { r l r } { r } & { { } = } & { 0 . 1 7 5 } \end{array}$ (95% CI $[ - 0 . 0 2 4 , 0 . 3 6 1 ] )$ on ARC.

The disagreement is also visible at the question level. The mean absolute gap is 0.080 on MMLU and 0.045 on ARC. A gap larger than 0.10 occurs for 23.0% of MMLU questions and 15.2% of ARC questions, while gaps larger than 0.20 occur for 19.0% and 10.1%, respectively.

These results quantify the extent to which the two confidence operationalizations differ on the same inputs. As established in Section 3, such disagreement is compatible with their definitions as distinct summaries of the autoregressive predictive process; the empirical result here concerns its magnitude and frequency.

## 6.2 Confidence Signals Differ in Their Association with Correctness

The two confidence signals also differ in their relationship with answer correctness. Global confidence shows a moderate positive association with correctness on both datasets: $r = 0 . 4 9 4$ (95% CI [0.329, 0.627]) on MMLU and $r = 0 . 3 7 4$ (95% CI [0.189, 0.530]) on ARC.

By comparison, local confidence shows little association with correctness: $r = 0 . 1 0 2 ( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } \left[ - 0 . 0 9 6 , 0 . 2 9 3 \right] )$ on MMLU and $r = 0 . 0 7 2 ( 9 5 \% \mathrm { C I } \left[ - 0 . 1 2 8 , 0 . 2 6 6 \right] )$ on ARC.

Thus, in these experiments, the two confidence measurements are not only weakly associated with one another but also differ in the information they provide about whether the model’s selected answer is correct. These correlations characterize confidence–correctness association and should not be interpreted as complete measures of probabilistic calibration.

The reported split ranges are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles across partitions and are not confidence intervals.

## 6.3 Sampling Instability Differs Between MMLU and ARC

Before examining the relationship between confidence disagreement and sampling instability, we characterize the amount of instability available at the question level. Under the baseline $T = 0 . 7 , N = 3 0$ condition, MMLU exhibits mean answer entropy of 0.025, with 4% of questions producing more than one distinct answer. ARC exhibits greater variability, with mean entropy of 0.071 and approximately 11% of questions producing more than one answer.

Sampling instability is therefore sparse on both datasets but particularly rare on MMLU. This difference is important for interpreting the subsequent question-level analysis: ARC provides substantially more variation with which to identify an association between confidence disagreement and sampling instability, whereas MMLU operates close to a floor in the instability measures.

## 6.4 Confidence Disagreement Tracks Sampling Instability

We next test whether question-level local–global confidence disagreement is associated with question-level sampling instability. Table 3 reports the corresponding associations and the companion analysis using local confidence alone.

On ARC, larger confidence gaps are consistently associated with greater sampling instability. The absolute gap $D ( x )$ is positively associated with answer entropy (Spearman $\rho = 0 . 4 1 8 )$ and the number of distinct sampled answers $( \rho = 0 . 4 1 )$ , and negatively associated with modalanswer probability $( \rho = - 0 . 4 2 )$ . These associations remain significant after Benjamini–Hochberg correction (adjusted $p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ ).

The stable–unstable comparison yields the same pattern. ARC questions that produce more than one answer under repeated sampling have a median absolute confidence gap of 0.12, compared with 0.00 among stable questions, with a rank-biserial effect size of 0.76.

The corresponding gap–entropy relationship on MMLU is weaker $( \rho = 0 . 2 1 5 )$ . Only four of 100 MMLU questions are unstable under the baseline sampling condition, leaving comparatively little question-level variation with which to estimate relationships involving sampling instability.

The primary global-confidence estimate uses 60 samples, including the 30 baseline samples from which the primary instability measures are computed. We therefore repeat the gap–entropy analysis using non-overlapping stochastic samples. Across 200 random 15/15 partitions, the ARC association remains close to the pooled estimate: $\rho = 0 . 4 1 8$ in the pooled analysis and mean $\rho = 0 . 3 9 7$ across disjoint splits, with a 2.5–97.5% split range of [0.354, 0.422]. MMLU is similarly stable, with $\rho = 0 . 2 1 5$ in the pooled analysis and mean $\rho = 0 . 2 1 4$ across disjoint splits, with a split range of $[ 0 . 1 8 4 , 0 . 2 3 5 ]$

The persistence of the relationship under disjoint estimation indicates that shared finite-sample variation between the global-confidence and instability estimates does not account for the observed association.

As a companion analysis, we examine local confidence independently of the local–global gap. On ARC, higher local confidence is associated with lower sampling instability (Spearman $\rho = - 0 . 3 1$ , BH-adjusted $p = 0 . 0 0 3 )$ , and unstable questions exhibit lower local confidence (rank-biserial effect size = −0.56). On MMLU, local confidence shows little relationship with instability $( \rho = - 0 . 0 9 , p = 0 . 4 8 )$ . Because $c _ { \mathrm { l o c a l } }$ is obtained from a separate greedy log-probability call, this comparison does not share the stochastic samples used to estimate instability.

Taken together, the ARC results show that questions exhibiting greater local–global confidence disagreement also exhibit greater variability under repeated sampling. The relationship remains essentially unchanged when disagreement and instability are estimated from non-overlapping stochastic draws. The weaker MMLU relationship occurs in a regime where sampling instability is rare.

## 7 Discussion

Confidence depends on how the predictive distribution is summarized. The central empirical result is that local token confidence and global answer concentration behave as distinct confidence measurements, even when obtained from the same model on the same inputs. Their correlation is weak on both MMLU and ARC, and non-trivial local–global gaps occur for a substantial fraction of questions. This disagreement is not unexpected from first principles: the two quantities summarize different aspects of an autoregressive predictive process. The empirical contribution is therefore not the existence of a possible mismatch, but its magnitude and whether that mismatch is systematically related to observable model behavior.

Local and global confidence carry different information about correctness. The two confidence signals also differ markedly in their association with answer correctness. Global confidence is moderately associated with correctness on both MMLU and ARC, whereas local confidence shows little relationship with correctness. This asymmetry indicates that the probability assigned to a selected answer token and the concentration of probability mass across sampled answers should not be treated as interchangeable measures of model

confidence.

One likely contributor to this difference is the operational definition of local confidence used here. Because c is the probability of the greedy-selected answer token, it is conditioned on a locally preferred continuation and is frequently concentrated near high values. By contrast, c<sub>global</sub> summarizes concentration across complete sampled answers. The two measurements consequently retain different information about the predictive process. We do not interpret the confidence–correctness correlations reported here as complete measures of probabilistic calibration.

Confidence disagreement tracks sampling instability. The question-level analysis provides the strongest new evidence in the study. On ARC, larger local–global confidence gaps are associated with higher answer entropy, more distinct sampled answers, lower modal-answer concentration, and a greater likelihood of observing more than one answer under repeated sampling. The stable–unstable comparison yields the same pattern: unstable questions exhibit substantially larger confidence gaps.

This relationship is not reducible to a generic effect of low local confidence. On ARC, local confidence alone is negatively associated with instability (ρ = −0.31), whereas the local–global gap exhibits a stronger positive association with answer entropy (ρ = 0.42). The gap therefore captures the relationship between a locally concentrated prediction and the concentration of the resulting answer distribution, rather than simply identifying questions for which the local prediction is uncertain.

The corresponding relationship is substantially weaker on MMLU. However, MMLU operates in a near-floor instability regime, with only four of 100 questions producing more than one answer under the baseline condition. The contrast between ARC and MMLU therefore indicates that the observability of the gap–instability relationship depends on there being sufficient variation in sampling behavior.

The relationship is robust to disjoint sampling but remains diagnostic. The primary analysis estimates global confidence from 60 pooled samples, 30 of which are also used to estimate the baseline instability measures. This creates shared finite-sample variation between the two estimates. The disjoint-sample analysis directly tests whether this overlap accounts for the observed relationship.

It does not. On ARC, the gap–entropy correlation is ρ = 0.418 in the pooled analysis and averages ρ = 0.397 across 200 disjoint-sample splits (2.5-97.5% split interval [0.354, 0.422]). On MMLU, the corresponding estimates are ρ = 0.215 and ρ = 0.214 ([0.184, 0.235]). The persistence of the association under non-overlapping sampling therefore indicates that it is not explained by shared Monte Carlo variation.

This robustness result does not, however, establish causal direction. Global confidence and sampling entropy remain different summaries of the same underlying answer distribution even when estimated from independent draws. Their association can therefore arise because both reflect latent variation in that distribution. The present experiments establish that local–global disagreement tracks sampling instability across questions; they do not establish whether disagreement contributes to instability, instability enlarges the observed confidence gap, or both reflect a common property of the predictive distribution.

Implications for evaluation, oversight, and alignment. These results have implications beyond the comparison of uncertainty metrics. Confidence increasingly serves as an interface between model predictions and downstream mechanisms for evaluation, abstention, human review, feedback, and control. Such mechanisms implicitly require a choice about which property of the predictive process is being treated as confidence.

The present results show that this choice can be consequential. Local token confidence and sampled answer concentration can assign substantially different confidence to the same input, exhibit different relationships with correctness, and disagree most strongly on questions that also exhibit greater sampling instability. A downstream mechanism conditioned on one confidence readout may therefore receive materially different information from one conditioned on another, even when both are described as responding to “model confidence.”

This constitutes a measurement problem for confidencebased alignment and oversight rather than evidence about alignment performance itself. Before a confidence signal can be calibrated against correctness, used to trigger deferral, or incorporated into human or automated feedback, the quantity being measured must be specified. Our results suggest that confidence should not be assumed to provide a representationindependent scalar summary of the model’s predictive state.

Future work. The immediate next step is to determine whether the observed relationships generalize across model families, scales, and training regimes. Larger benchmark samples are also needed to characterize low-instability regimes such as MMLU more precisely.

A second direction is to test robustness to calibration of the local confidence signal. In particular, post-hoc temperature scaling would test whether the observed local–global asymmetry and its relationship with sampling instability persist after rescaling local token probabilities. Because such calibration was not performed here, the present results do not establish invariance to this transformation.

Finally, extending the analysis beyond constrained-answer tasks will require explicit treatment of semantic equivalence, since surface-form diversity can otherwise be confounded with genuine answer-level instability.

## 8 Conclusion

Local token confidence and global answer concentration provide empirically distinct views of the same autoregressive predictive process. In our experiments, the two signals show weak agreement, differ substantially in their association with correctness, and, on ARC, their disagreement is systematically associated with sampling instability at the question level. This association persists when confidence disagreement and instability are estimated from disjoint stochastic samples, indicating that it is not explained by shared finitesample variation.

These results support treating confidence as an explicitly defined measurement rather than as a single intrinsic scalar property of a language model. In particular, token-level confidence and sampling-derived answer concentration should not be assumed to be interchangeable. The local–global confidence gap provides a simple diagnostic for identifying inputs on which these two readouts diverge and sampling behavior is less stable.

The present results establish association rather than causal direction, and determining why confidence disagreement and sampling instability co-occur remains an open empirical question. More broadly, however, the findings expose a measurement problem for systems that use confidence as an input to evaluation, oversight, or control. If different readouts of the same predictive process disagree and carry different information about correctness and stability, then “model confidence” cannot be treated as an operationally unique quantity without specifying how it is measured. Establishing which confidence representation is appropriate for a given downstream objective is therefore a prerequisite for using confidence reliably in such systems.

Limitations The study has several limitations. First, all experiments use a single quantized Llama 3.3 70B model, so the magnitude of the observed effects may differ across model families, scales, and training regimes. Second, the primary local–global analysis uses approximately 100 questions from MMLU and ARC. This limits precision, particularly in lowinstability regimes such as MMLU, where only four questions exhibit sampling instability under the baseline condition.

Third, the local-confidence measure used here is specifically the probability assigned to the greedy-selected answer token. The results therefore characterize this operationalization rather than token-level uncertainty measures in general. Global confidence is estimated through repeated sampling and consequently depends on the sampling configuration and finite sample budget. We also do not test whether the observed relationships persist after post-hoc calibration, such as temperature scaling of the local confidence signal.

Fourth, the primary comparison is restricted to multiplechoice tasks. This is deliberate: constrained answer spaces reduce ambiguity from synonyms, paraphrases, and surfaceform variation, allowing local token probabilities and sampled answer frequencies to be compared at a common answer level. Extending the analysis to open-ended generation will require explicit treatment of semantic equivalence.

Finally, the gap–instability analysis is observational. In the primary analysis, global confidence is estimated from 60 pooled samples, 30 of which are also used to estimate baseline sampling instability. We therefore repeat the analysis across 200 disjoint splits, estimating the two quantities from non-overlapping stochastic draws; the gap–entropy association remains essentially unchanged. This rules out shared finite-sample variation as an explanation for the observed relationship. However, global confidence and sampling instability remain summaries of the same underlying answer distribution. The analysis therefore supports a diagnostic association, not a causal interpretation of the relationship.

Broader Impacts The study concerns measurement and evaluation rather than the development of new model capabilities. Its primary implication is that confidence estimates should be reported together with a clear definition of how they are obtained. Treating distinct confidence signals as interchangeable may obscure meaningful differences in model behavior, particularly when confidence is used to support downstream decisions.

Comparing multiple confidence readouts may therefore improve diagnostic evaluation of model reliability. At the same time, disagreement between confidence measures should not itself be interpreted as a calibrated estimate of risk or as evidence of a particular causal mechanism. In higher-stakes applications, any such diagnostic should be validated for the specific model, task, and deployment setting before being used operationally.
